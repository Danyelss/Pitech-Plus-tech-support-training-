A thread is the smallest unit that can be scheduled in an operating sistem. 
Kernel threads are part of the opreating system. User-space threads are not implemented in the kernel. 
Every process has at least one thread. On a single proccessor machine, 
the parallel execution of threads is achieved by thread scheduling or timeslicing.
