List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists. 
One common use case is making new lists where each element is the result of some operations 
applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those 
elements that satisfy a certain condition. Syntax : newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
