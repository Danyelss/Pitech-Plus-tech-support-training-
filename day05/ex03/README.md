Datastore is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high <br> performance, and ease of application development. Datastore features include:<br>
Atomic transactions: can execute a set of operations where either all succeed, <br> or none occur. <br>
High availability of reads and writes: runs in Google data centers resulting <br>
less impact from points of failure. <br>
Massive scalability with high performance: distributed architecture to manage scaling. <br>
Flexible storage and querying of data: datastores maps naturally to object-oriented and scripting languages <br>
Balance of strong and eventual consistency: entity lookups by key and consistent queries <br>
Encryption at rest: encrypts all data before it is written to disk and decrypts when read by an authorized user. <br>
Fully managed with no planned downtime: no downtime <br>
<br>
A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming <br>
interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST <br> 
architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. <br> 
REST stands for representational state transfer
