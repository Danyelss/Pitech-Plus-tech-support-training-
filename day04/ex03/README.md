HTTP(S) Load Balancing is a proxy-based Layer 7 load balancer that enables
you to run and scale your services behind a single external IP address.
The external HTTP(S) load balancer provides the frontend IP addresses and ports that receive requests and the backends that respond to the requests.
The regional external HTTP(S) load balancer supports advanced traffic management capabilities.
