where tables are dynamically updated. <br>
Standard routing requires less bandwith than dynamic routing. <br>
In static routing paths are define by administrative unlike dynamic routing where paths are updated according to the changes in the network.
Static routing in implemented in small networks, dynamic routing is implemented in large networks.
Dynamic routing requires complex algorithms, static routing does not.
Dynamic routing is less secure than static routing.
