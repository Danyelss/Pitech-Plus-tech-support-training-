In static routing, routing tables are manually updated, in contrast to dynamic routing, 
where tables are dynamically updated. <br>
Standard routing requires less bandwith than dynamic routing. <br>
In static routing paths are define by administrative unlike dynamic routing where paths are updated according to the changes in the network. <br>
Static routing in implemented in small networks, dynamic routing is implemented in large networks. <br>
Dynamic routing requires complex algorithms, static routing does not. <br>
Dynamic routing is less secure than static routing. <br>
Link failure disturbs routing in static routing as opposed to dynamic routing where failure does not disturb the process.
