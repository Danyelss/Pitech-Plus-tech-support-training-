The performance of web sites and applications can be significantly <br>
improved by reusing previously fetched resources. <br>
Web caches reduce latency and network traffic and <br>
thus lessen the time needed to display resource representations. <br>
HTTP caching makes Web sites more responsive. <br> <br>
The main difference between Cache and Cookie is that, <br>
Cache is used to store online page resources during <br>
a browser for the long run purpose or to decrease the loading time.<br>
On the other hand, cookies are employed to store user choices <br>
such as browsing session to trace the user preferences.<br> <br>
The Cache-Control HTTP header holds directives (instructions)<br>
for caching in both requests and responses. <br>
If a given directive is in a request, it does not mean <br>
this directive is in the response. <br>
