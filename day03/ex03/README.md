The external IP helps the machine connect to the internet from inside the private network 
in contrast to the internal IP which lets the devices from the private network 
communicate to each other. 
External IPs are traceable by external entities, different from internal IPs which 
are only traceable by local devices. External IPs named also Public IPs have an 
unic numeric code that can't be use by other devices, in contrast Private IPs 
have a numeric code that can be reused by other devices in the private network. 
The Public IP adress is assigned and controlled by the internet provider, 
as opposed to the Private IP adress which is assigned by the specific provider within the 
private network.
